This application is a linkedin scraper in which you fill the
search bar with what you wanna look for (ex: web designer)
and you fill the inputs with the filters you wanna apply 
(location , school , company ...) and the message you wanna send
to the people that will show up and press 'send'.
###########################################################
fill the text file 'credentials.txt' with the email in first line
and password in the second one.
It'd be better if it's a premium linkedin account.
